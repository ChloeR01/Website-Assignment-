                    <h2>Report</h2> <!--Report on website design-->
                    <br>
                    <p1>The design throughout my website is very repetitive and simplistic this is because I wanted to create a website that was easily accessible and usable for my target audience. On all my pages upon my website I had used a navigation bar in a fixed position at the top of the page. This is so that users can easily access it and alternate between all the different pages upon the site. In the navigation bar I chose to use icons instead of text this is so that it is more appealing to my target audience along with catching their attention more. When the user hovers over an icon a tag will appear giving the user information about what the icon is. For example, if the user goes to click the computer icon it’ll display text saying computing, so they know what to expect when proceeding onto that page upon the website. <br>
                        <br>
                        Underneath the navigation bar on every page upon the website, I had included an automatic slideshow this is where I have placed images relating to subject or products presented on the webpage. I had a few implications when creating this section upon my site for example making it manual. Therefore, further down the page you will see a second slideshow this one is only manual where the user can switch between the images using the back-and-forth buttons displayed underneath. Giving them the opportunity to further explore the adverts by clicking on the image and it is sending them directly to the assigned page of the advert. <br>
                        <br>
                        On all main pages such as Home, Computing, Gaming and Phones I had created rows of three columns where I had inserted information about relevant products relating to the page that the user was viewing. All images have curved edges to make the pictures match the shape of the buttons placed underneath them. All buttons presented underneath the images are clickable so when the user clicked a button it’ll sending them directly to the product to read further information upon. When hovering over a selected image the image will slightly rise this was useful in the design as it allows users to know what items they are currently looking at. <br>
                        <br>
                        At the bottom of each page, I had placed a footer including some of Curry’s social media pages. Along with a container which included information about all relevant services that they provide. All information was taken from the official curry’s website. <br>
                        <br>
                        On the products page, each product has a main preview image of the product along with 4 other smaller images. On the right-hand side of the images the user is presented with information about the product, an option where they can select the colour of the item they wanted, a star rating of the product and lastly a further description button. When the user proceeds on to the further description page, they will be presented with the four smaller images again. If the user was to click onto the smaller images it will replace the main image with the selected image this was coded using JavaScript. <br>
                        <br>
                        On each individual product page there is a brief section which uses xml this is used to display the specification of the product. This gives the user further information regarding the product they are viewing. <br>
                        <br>
                        On the sign-up form I had used a simple layout so that users can access it easily, I started with text boxes where the user inputs the designated information into the correct boxes so that they can submit a sign in form. On the password section I had provided more information on what was needed to create successful password this was done by using JavaScript, the aim was if the user inputted a password shorter than 8 characters it appears red and if it’s between 8 -20 characters it appears green meaning its successful. I had also included email validation which makes sure the user enters a .com or.co.uk into the box before submitting as well as an email address after the @. <br>
                        <br>
                        In conclusion, I feel like the overall aims of the website have been achieved because I made the website not only accessible and usable for the user but made sure that all elements on each page are fully functional. The overall colour scheme of all pages is consistent with the use of black, grey, and white throughout the entire website. All elements added in the navigation bar had a similar design and were the same size throughout making it more appealing to the customer. To further improve my website, I would make sure that the buttons for the slideshow are in line with each other, the xml information is placed into a grid and is more presentable to the user. <br>
